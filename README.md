# Apixa

**Define your API once. Use it everywhere.**

Apixa is an open-source, TypeScript-first library for defining APIs and generating fully typed API clients from a single source of truth.

Instead of repeatedly writing request functions, types, URL construction, and response handling for every resource, Apixa aims to let you define your API once and handle the repetitive mechanics automatically.

## Why Apixa?

Working with APIs often means repeating the same patterns across resources and projects:

- Writing request functions for every endpoint.
- Maintaining request and response types separately.
- Reimplementing headers, parsing, and error handling.
- Repeating common resource operations.
- Integrating API calls with different data-fetching libraries.

Apixa aims to reduce this duplication while preserving TypeScript's type safety and flexibility.

## Core Principles

- **Define once:** Keep API definitions in a single source of truth.
- **Type-safe by design:** Infer request arguments and response types from definitions.
- **Convention-driven:** Generate common resource operations where appropriate.
- **Fully customizable:** Support custom endpoints and override generated behavior.
- **Framework-agnostic:** Keep the core independent of UI frameworks and data-fetching libraries.
- **Composable:** Allow additional capabilities through optional packages.

## Usage (implemented)

```ts
import { defineApi } from "@apixa/core";

type User = { id: string; name: string; email: string };

const api = defineApi({
  baseURL: "https://api.example.com",
  headers: { Accept: "application/json" },
  users: {
    path: "/users",
    operations: {
      getAll: { method: "GET", response: {} as User[] },
      getByID: { method: "GET", path: "/:id", response: {} as User },
      create: { method: "POST", body: {} as Omit<User, "id">, response: {} as User },
      update: { method: "PUT", path: "/:id", body: {} as Partial<User>, response: {} as User },
      delete: { method: "DELETE", path: "/:id", response: undefined as void },
    },
  },
});

const users = await api.users.getAll();
const user = await api.users.getByID("123");
const created = await api.users.create({ name: "Ada", email: "ada@example.com" });
```

Operations return native `Promise<T>` (response data is unwrapped). Only operations listed in the resource config are generated. A custom definition for a convention name (`getByID`, …) overrides the default method/path.

Pass `transport` to inject a custom HTTP implementation (used in tests). The default is Fetch, shipped inside `@apixa/core`.

See [`examples/next`](./examples/next) for the primary real-app playground (Next.js). Other frontends (React/Vite, Vue, vanilla, Angular, React Native) and a Node CLI live under [`examples/`](./examples/). Platform run scripts: [`scripts/README.md`](./scripts/README.md).

## Vision

Apixa is being designed around a small, extensible core that can grow into a broader API development ecosystem.

**Implemented in v0.1.0:** resource definitions via `defineApi()`, opt-in operations, type inference, URL/body/headers, Fetch transport, standardized errors.

**Planned later** (not in Core yet):

- Middleware as a stable public API, retries, pagination conventions.
- Mocking package (not coupled to production execution).
- Optional TanStack Query integration.
- Browser and server packages.
- OpenAPI interoperability.
- Additional transports extracted from Core.

These planned items are not currently implemented.

## Design Philosophy

Apixa Core will provide API definitions, type inference, and request execution without requiring React, TanStack Query, or a particular runtime framework.

Integrations will build on the core rather than become dependencies of it.

API methods are intended to return native promises, allowing them to work naturally with `async`/`await` and libraries such as TanStack Query.

## Project Status

Apixa is in early development at **v0.1.0**. `@apixa/core` exposes `defineApi()` with opt-in resource operations, Fetch as the default transport, and injectable `Transport` for tests.

See [versions/v0.1.0/acceptance-criteria.md](./versions/v0.1.0/acceptance-criteria.md) for the milestone checklist.
