# Versions

Each folder under `versions/` freezes the coding contract for one milestone.

## How it works

1. Living direction lives in [`docs/`](../docs/) (`context`, `architecture`, `roadmap`, `conventions`, ADRs).
2. When a milestone starts, create `versions/vX.Y.Z/` with the four files below.
3. Implement against that folder until acceptance criteria pass.
4. Do **not** create empty future version folders. Describe later work in [`docs/roadmap.md`](../docs/roadmap.md) until that milestone begins.

## Required files per version

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `context.md` | Frozen subset of project context for this release |
| `scope.md` | Explicit in / out |
| `implementation-plan.md` | Ordered smallest-path plan |
| `acceptance-criteria.md` | Checklist that gates “done” |

## Current

| Version | Status | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **v0.2.0** | Active — coding contract | [v0.2.0/](./v0.2.0/) |

## Completed

| Version | Status | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v0.1.0 | Shipped — opt-in operations foundation | [v0.1.0/](./v0.1.0/) |

## Later (roadmap only)

v0.3.0 and v1.0.0 are outlined in the roadmap. Create their folders when each milestone starts—not before.
