description: Open a GitHub issue and a task branch from a short brief
---

The developer is starting a change. The words they typed after `/plan-change` are the brief. Prep the issue and open it. Do not write the code.

## Stop first

Stop and ask what the change is if the brief is empty.

Stop if the current branch is already `task/N-slug` for this same brief. Name the branch. Do not stack a second change on it.

If the current branch is any other branch (including another `task/…` branch), do not build on it. Still open the issue, then create the new task branch from latest `main` as below.

Read `docs/context.md` and the **Current** folder under `versions/` (see `versions/README.md`). Do not recap the project.

If the brief is “implement the version” or clearly the whole active milestone, prefer telling them to use `/implement-version` after the issue exists — still open the issue if they ran `/plan-change`.

If the brief asks for something in the active version’s **Out** of scope, say so in the issue body and in chat. Do not pretend it is in scope.

## Write the issue

Turn the brief into a specific issue. Keep their words.

Title is the outcome. "Add defineApi resource generation" is a title. "Working on core" is not.

Body, in this order:

```markdown
Asked for: <their brief, unchanged>

Active version: vX.Y.Z

<One or two sentences on the problem.>

<One or two sentences on the outcome.>

Touches:
- path/to/file

Tests:
- tests/core/<name>.test.ts — <what behavior this covers>
```

Touches lists every file you expect to edit. Include:

- `docs/context.md` and/or `docs/architecture.md` when direction changes
- `docs/story.md` when the log will change
- `versions/vX.Y.Z/*` only when correcting or completing that milestone’s contract (not for unrelated future work)
- **`tests/` paths for every functional change** (see Tests below)

Leave a file off the list when you are not sure, and say that in the chat.

## Tests (required for functional changes)

Apixa aims for a **large, growing** suite under root [`tests/`](../../tests/). Planning a change that alters runtime behavior, public API, types that affect callers, error paths, URL/body/headers, or operation generation **must** plan tests in the same issue.

For each such change:

1. Add a **Tests:** section to the issue body (not optional fluff — concrete files + behaviors).
2. Put those test files on **Touches** as well (new or existing `tests/core/*.test.ts`, helpers under `tests/helpers/`).
3. Prefer **many small cases** over one vague “works” test: happy path, edge cases, overrides, error path, and type/behavior regressions that the change could break.
4. Use injectable / fake `Transport` — no flaky live network as the primary suite (see `tests/README.md`).
5. If the brief is docs-only / process-only and truly has no behavior change, write `Tests: none (no functional change)` and say why in chat.

Do **not** plan a functional Core change with an empty or missing Tests section. The long-term goal is a huge number of tests covering Core thoroughly; each `/plan-change` should add to that pile when behavior moves.

Label the issue `task`. Repo is `a2mbyd/apixa`.

```bash
gh issue create --repo a2mbyd/apixa --title "Add defineApi resource generation" --label "task" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
...
EOF
)"
```

The developer already asked to open it by running this command. Do not ask for a second yes.

## Branch

Always start the task branch from latest `main`. Never create it from the current checkout if that checkout is a sub-branch.

N is the new issue number. The slug is short, lowercase, and hyphenated.

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git switch -c task/N-slug
```

Leave unrelated dirty files unstaged. If the switch or pull would overwrite them, stop and name the files.

## Reply

Give the issue URL, the branch name, the active version, the Touches list, and the Tests list (or `none` with reason). Then wait. Do not start the edit unless the brief also said to implement it now.
