description: Commit the change, open the pull request, squash merge, and write the log
---

The developer is done. `/git-push` is the yes to merge. Close the work by landing it on `main`.

## Stop first

Read the branch name. It must be `task/N-slug`. N is the issue number. If you are on `main`, stop.

Read issue N. Stay inside its Touches list. If a file you need is not listed, stop and name it. Do not add it quietly.

If there is nothing to commit and no existing pull request, stop.

Leave unrelated dirty files unstaged. Do not commit `.env`, credentials, or a `package-lock.json` from an unrelated install.

## Update from main

Before push and before merge, always pull latest `main` into the task branch. Never push or merge from a stale base.

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git switch task/N-slug
git rebase origin/main
```

If the rebase stops on conflicts, stop and name the files. Do not push or merge until the branch is rebased on latest `main`.

## Log the change

Update `docs/context.md` when the current picture changed.

If acceptance criteria for the active version were completed, check them off in `versions/vX.Y.Z/acceptance-criteria.md` and note completion in the story entry.

Add an entry at the **top** of `docs/story.md` (newest first). Do not edit an older entry.

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — Short outcome title

Two or three sentences. What landed, and what it changed about the repo. Name the version if this advanced a milestone.
```

Use today's date. Name the outcome. "Updated docs" is not an entry.

## Commit

Subject is `type: why`, present tense, under 72 characters, no trailing period. Types used here are `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, and `chore`.

The body is one or two sentences a teammate would want in `git log`. Skip the body only when the subject already says the why.

```text
docs: add version coding contract for v0.1.0

Agents and humans need a frozen scope and acceptance checklist before Core work.
```

```bash
git add <files on the Touches list>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type: why

Why this change exists.

EOF
)"
```

Run the Update from main steps, then push:

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

If the branch was already on the remote and the rebase rewrote commits, use `git push --force-with-lease`.

## Pull request

If this branch already has an open pull request, use it. Do not open a second one.

If it does not, create one. The first line is `Closes #N`.

```bash
gh pr create --repo a2mbyd/apixa --base main --title "Add defineApi resource generation" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Closes #N

## Summary
- What changed, in one line per point.

## Test plan
- [ ] What a person can check.

EOF
)"
```

The title matches the issue outcome.

## Merge

Run the Update from main steps again. If the rebase moved commits, push with `--force-with-lease`. Then merge.

```bash
gh pr merge N --repo a2mbyd/apixa --squash --delete-branch
```

Confirm `main` is checked out, it matches `origin/main`, and the task branch is gone. `Closes #N` closes the issue. Do not close it by hand before the merge.

## Reply

Send the pull request URL, the squash commit on `main`, and the story sentences you added.
